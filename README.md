### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D__n Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your screenshot of docker ps output](Images/docker_ps_output.png)

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._

### Optional configurations


The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![Network Diagram](https://github.com/rrazumov-rrs/rrazumov-rrs/blob/main/Diagrams/ELK_STACK_PROJECT-BONUS.png)

Changes made:

- Added another elk slack server for redundancy
- Added both servers on the load balancer with public ip address
- Load balancer automatically redirects requests on port 80 to port 5601
- Both DVWA and ELK are accessible not only by ip address, but by FQDN

**Trying to add shorter and more custom FQDN**
